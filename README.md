HI 🥂
This project is a part of the curricullum of the Responsive Web Desing Certification offered by FreecodeCamp.org
Typography is the art of styling your text to be easily readable and suit its purpose.
For this project, I was intended to use typography to build a nutrition label webpage. 

📝I learnt how to :
🚀style text, 
🚀adjust line height, 
🚀position text using CSS.
